# osu! - Twitch Integration Tool

## A tool for twitch streamers to make osu beatmap request accessible in-game

This project was inspired by [Ronnia Bot](https://github.com/aticie/ronnia-selfhost) and [osu_request-bot](https://github.com/Fanyatsu/osu-requests-bot)

## Installation

Simply go to [Release page](https://github.com/LeTextur/OTIT-Self_Host/releases/latest) and download a .zip file with name *OTIT v0.x.x*.
Then extract an .exe file and *_internal* folder to the same directory and open the exe file.

## Is this a virus?

Sometimes Windows Defender or other antivirus software will detect a .exe file as a virus. This happen to all software that don't have a code signing certificate.
That certificate cost too much for "solo coder". To prevent that I sugest to add as exception in your antivirus.

## Known issues

- When you change the language without saving, the console will not be translated.
- Sometimes the program doesn't quit and stays in your RAM (only uses around 70MB).
- When you put max slider handle to the left it will recognize as 0 instead of âˆž
